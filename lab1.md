## cd command examples
![Image](cd.png)

The command itself changes the directory when it runs:
* In the first example, the working directory is "/home/lecture1/". Command cd with no arguments changes the directory back to home directory (/home).
* In the second example, the working directory is "/home/". Command cd with a path to directory "cd lecture1" changes the working directory to "/home/lecture1/", which is the path in the given argument. Although lecture1 is not an absolute path, the command still works. The reason is that lecture1 is a directory within home directory (the working directory).
* In the third example, the working directory is "/home/leture1/". Command cd with a path to file "cd Hello.java" returns an error message saying that the given argument is not a directory. The reason is that the cd command is used for changing the working directory and it does not take a path to a file as an argument.
